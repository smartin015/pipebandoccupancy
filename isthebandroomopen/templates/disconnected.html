<h1> The unit is disconnected :( </h1>


<h2>Troubleshooting:</h2>
<p>Is the unit plugged in? 
It's a small black cube with a sensor on it, that plugs into a USB port. </p>

<p>Is the script running? Check for the bagpipe tray icon. If not, 
you'll find a shortcut in Start->All Programs->Startup. Click it and the icon should appear!</p>
