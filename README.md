Pipe Band Occupancy Sensor
=================

Determines if the pipe band room is used/unused

Installation
------------

1) In the "DigiUSB Windows Driver", double-click InstallDriver.exe and follow the instructions.
This enables USB support for the detector. 

2) Plug in the detector - it should scan for device drivers and install everything automatically.

3) Double-click "detector.vbs" in the root folder. This launches the monitor and listens 
to the detector for ambient light levels. You can tell if the program is running by 
looking in your icon tray - there should be a white icon with a bagpipe on it. 

4) To close the program, simply right-click the tray icon and select Exit. 


Running on Startup (Recommended)
------------------

If you'd like the program to run when the computer starts, right-click "detector.vbs"
and select "Create Shortcut". Click and drag the shortcut file to your 
Start Menu->All Programs->Startup folder. You can also find this folder at 
C:\Users\<user name here>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
